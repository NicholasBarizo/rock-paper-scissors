# Rock Paper Scissors Project

This is my first experience in connecting JavaScript to HTML via things like event listeners and get elements. I had struggled initially with the HTML integration as I was completely new to the relationship between JavaScript and the DOM. For example, I thought event listeners had to be re-added for every button press. Fortunately, The Odin Project made this much easier. The Rock Paper Scissors project is part of their curriculum, and the assignment gave me a small understanding on DOM manipulation. This small understanding gave me a basis on which to work towards the project's completion. The foundation that comes with this project should make future projects considerably easier.

# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first experience in connecting JavaScript to HTML via things like event listeners and get elements. I had struggled initially with the HTML integration as I was completely new to the relationship between JavaScript and the DOM. Fortunately, The Odin Project made this much easier. The Rock Paper Scissors project is part of their curriculum, and the assignment gave me a small understanding on DOM manipulation. This small understanding gave me a basis on which to work towards the project's completion. The foundation that comes with this project should make future projects considerably easier.
